Here is how it works

What works

So far, what works, is that it selects recipes based on what is in the inventory

What it needs now is to select palatable, nutrition, cheap recipes.

Write another program to do that.



Salad w/ meat, nuts, olive oil, spices (garlic, misses dash flavors, parsley, basely, oregano),
(tomatoe sauces),

Grocery once every week, less often foods expire (frozen works, likes taste of fresh)

Variation in fruits

Plain meat chicken, freeze, cook, refrigerate, potatoes

??So hungry can't make meal??

Cereal, more often on days when felt not having high vitamin take
